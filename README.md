# computer-vision-algorithms
Python project containing 4 folders with computer vision applications and advanced image processing in distributed virtual environments.

- [Computer Vision 1](https://github.com/Iri25/image-processing/tree/main/Computer%20Vision%201) folder contains an application for overlaying a logo image over a scene image and implementing the fill contour using the morphological operations algorithm.
- [Computer Vision 2](https://github.com/Iri25/image-processing/tree/main/Computer%20Vision%202) folder contains an application that uses morphological operators to extract corners from an image.
- [Computer Vision 3](https://github.com/Iri25/image-processing/tree/main/Computer%20Vision%203) folder contains an application that uses a dataset of images and for a new image determine the set of images similar to the input image from the database.
- [Computer Vision 4](https://github.com/Iri25/image-processing/tree/main/Computer%20Vision%204) folder contains an application for line and circle detection using the Hough method.
