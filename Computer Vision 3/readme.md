### Problems:
Write an application that uses a dataset of images (of at least) 30-50 images downloaded from internet with various content (landscapes, objects, people, etc). The application should take a new image as input argument 
and determine the set of similar images from the database:
1. using all histogram comparison metrics available in OpenCV.
2. By using a color reduction mechanism to transform similar colors from an equivalence class to its representative color and conducting the histogram comparison on the reduced color spaces.
